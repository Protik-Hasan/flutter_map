## Support Us

Please consider donating anything you can to us, we're extremely grateful for any and all donations. They keep us going and will allow us to cover any unforeseen or future costs, and potentially open up more doors and opportunities in future!

We'll donate 15% of what we receive to the OpenStreetMap Foundation, as a thanks for their excellent work. The remainder goes directly to improving flutter\_map.

Enter a nickname to be listed below in [#past-supporters](supporters.md#past-supporters "mention"), and enter your Discord username to be granted the "Supporter" role on our server and gain access to a special supporter-only chat channel. These benefits last indefinitely (but may take 48 hours to grant, as this is done manually).

* [**Donate with GBP**](https://donate.stripe.com/14kg1s1CB0dSdk4cMM) & British specific payment methods
* [**Donate with EUR**](https://donate.stripe.com/cN202ugxvbWA93O146) & European specific payment methods

We support a variety of payment methods through Stripe, although some have lower fees for us. In general, cards have the highest fees, and the closer the method to the bank, the lower the fees. Donating in the GBP currency also reduces our fees, but we provide EUR checkout to add extra payment methods for those living in Europe. If paying in a currency other than your own, your bank's exchange rate/terms will apply. At this time, only one-time donations are accepted: please get in touch if you'd like to donate on a regular basis.
